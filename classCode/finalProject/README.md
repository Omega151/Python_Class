# Welcome to a brand new address book!

A great way to store the address of any student you want! The feature that sets this project apart from the others is that it will store and save you changes in an external database. If you add, edit, or delete a student you can close the program and come back later to continue your work.

> _Make sure to include both `project.py` and `database.json` in the same directory before running the script._
